---

## 1. Business Overview
In todayâ€™s competitive retail market, understanding customer behavior is essential for effective marketing strategies. Since not all customers respond the same way to campaigns, segmentation and response analysis are critical.  

This analysis focuses on two priorities:  

1. **High-Value Customers (HVC):** Customers who generate significant revenue and demonstrate strong loyalty. Identifying their profiles enables tailored retention strategies.  

2. **Campaign Responsiveness:** Analyzing how different customer segments respond to campaigns provides insights into engagement levels, helping optimize targeting, improve conversion rates, and allocate resources more effectively.  

By distinguishing between customer segments and their behaviors, businesses can design precise strategies to strengthen loyalty, maximize lifetime value, and enhance overall marketing performance. 

**Key objectives**:
- Identify the characteristics of high-value customers and develop data-driven strategies to retain them.  
- Identify the characteristics of customer responses to marketing campaigns and determine appropriate strategies to enhance effectiveness.
